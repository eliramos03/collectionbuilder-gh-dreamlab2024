## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features sites objects from Preservation Allicance of Greater Philadelphia's Inventory of African American Historic Sites [Inventory of African American Historical Sites](https://www.preservationalliance.com/inventory-african-american-historic-sites/). 

For full details of creating your own collection site, visit [CollectionBuilder Documentation](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/)!
